# Configuration file for sshd(1m)
#
# The sshd shipped in this release of Solaris has support for major versions
# 1 and 2.  It is recommended due to security weaknesses in the v1 protocol
# that sites run only v2 if possible. Support for v1 is provided to help sites
# with existing ssh v1 clients/servers to transition. 
# Support for v1 may not be available in a future release of Solaris.
#
# To enable support for v1 an RSA1 key must be created with ssh-keygen(1).
# RSA and DSA keys for protocol v2 are created by /etc/init.d/sshd if they
# do not already exist, RSA1 keys for protocol v1 are not automatically created.
